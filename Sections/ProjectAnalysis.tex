\subsection{Dependencies}
We have two major dependencies coming into the second half of our project: our dynamic model for our leg and our dynamic model for our body. As seen in the schedule, we want to not only model our quadruped, but also give it basic control over its body. This will require a bullet proof model for each leg, which will be used for a dynamic body model. Although this is our reach goal, we hope to finish it within the next few weeks, and to have a demo ready.
