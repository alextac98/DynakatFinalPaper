\section{INTRODUCTION \& PROJECT REVIEW}
Legged robots are making great strides in the real world over the past couple of years. Boston dynamics for example are presenting working models performing complex tasks for real world applications. Our aim is to develop a 4 DOF quadruped robot inspired by agility and balancing capability of a real cat. We analyze our model by designing a dynamical model for a quadruped robot and simulating it on a robotic interface . From our project we will establish a fully parameterizable gait for our model. 

We have successfully completed the initial task of training in MATLAB 2018B along with SimMechanics, build a SimMechanics model of the body and each leg, and developed a kinematic model, as well as computing the Lagrangian of one leg (which is an important milestone in the process of dynamically modeling the robot). We plan to hit our expected goals and possibly some of our reach goals. The first task is to generate a dynamical model for each leg of the quadruped robot. Similarly, generate a dynamical model for the entire system including the body and legs. Following that, the next step is  to generate the forward kinematics and dynamics for the entire robot system.
