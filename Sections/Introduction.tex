\section{INTRODUCTION \& PROJECT REVIEW}
Legged robots will perhaps be one of the most important robots in the coming future. Although the software development need is very complex, legged robots have unique terrain traversal capabilities that is hard to emulate with other robot designs. In the past few years, these robots have been making great strides thanks to research institutions like MIT and companies like Boston Dynamics. 

However, the software still stands as one of the biggest hurdles for engineers to overcome. This project aims to develop an all-encompassing platform in MATLAB that will dynamically model a 4-DoF quadrupedal robot. Inspired by biology, we will be looking at using Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) and responses/reflexes. We will also look into using new ways to calculate inverse kinematics, including Forward \& Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) and analytical methods. Finally, we generate a dynamic model for the legs of the robot, and give it a basic walking gait for testing purposes.
