\section{CONCLUSION}
Overall, this project was a huge success, as we finished the majority of our goals and more. We designed and developed a parametric dynamic controller for a 4-DoF robotic quadruped. Future development of DynaKat could include integrating the FABRIK algorithm developed into the current dynamic model, making that model fully parametric. With a little more development, DynaKat can turn into a tool that engineers can use to control their own quadruped.
