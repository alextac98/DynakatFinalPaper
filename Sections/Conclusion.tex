\section{CONCLUSION}
Although we are on track with our original estimation, our team would like to be further ahead than we are. However, the steps we have taken to learn key concepts and develop good code has put us in a position that will hopefully expedite our future endeavours in our project. We are excited to see if our modeling approaches will allow us to achieve a torque controlled dynamic walking robot. If successful, this may provide a decent method to model and control commercial grade walking quadrupeds, and allow for more advanced stability studies and improvements to the controller.
